### Cyron
Welcome to Project Cyron, the first vm register based challenge made by over_on_top on discord aka overpower. 

### ❗ Goal of the challenge
- Noobs: Find the secret combination.
- Nerds: Recreate the algorithm and decrypt the secret message.

### ❓ Why I released this code?
- My previous VM challenge wasn't a real obfuscator, since it completely lacked an encryption mechanism, and as a result, it wasn't complex enough
- To fix that, I decided to create a new challenge, this time register-based instead of stack-based, with the addition of encryption and other security measures designed to make it more intricate and, above all, more fun to tackle.

### ⚙️ Features
- Anti-tampering
- Custom opcodes
- Encrypted constants
- Polymorphic obfuscation
- Custom virtual machine (VM)
- Encrypted identifiers (names)
- Full variable and function renaming

### 🏆 Winners
- 🥇 None
- 🥈 None
- 🥉 None
